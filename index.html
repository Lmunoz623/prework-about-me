      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love learning and puzzles and feel these are two things I would get with being a web developer. Technology is forever changing, so I will always be learning to keep up with the latest and greatest. I will also be able to put my problem solving mind at work when creating or debugging codes. Antoher reason is the versitality of being a web developer, working either solo or part of a team and being able to work from anywhere. </p>
